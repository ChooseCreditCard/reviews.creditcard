      <h1>Independent Reviews That Help You Understand What a Card Really Does</h1>
      <p class="hero-lead">
        Cards are more than their headline earn rate or signup bonus. Our reviews dive into real-world strengths and trade-offs: fees, perks, suitability for different spending patterns — so you can see whether a card works for you, not just looks good on paper.

  <!-- Overview -->
  <section id="overview" class="section">
    <h2>What We Cover in Each Review</h2>
    <p>Each review examines a card’s structure: annual fees, rewards or earn rate, bonus categories, benefits and perks, foreign transaction and conversion fees, redemption flexibility, and any limitations or fine-print clauses.</p>
    <p>We also simulate typical use-cases: everyday spending, travel, foreign currency transactions, cash withdrawals and high-volume categories — to estimate realistic net value rather than idealized “best-case” returns.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Methodology -->
  <section id="methodology" class="section">
    <h2>How We Analyze Cards — and What We Don’t Do</h2>
    <p>We use a standardized framework to assess cards: reward structure, fee analysis, benefit value, flexibility, and user-type fit. We assume responsible use (paying off balance each month) and vary spend levels to account for different user profiles — minimal spender, moderate user, heavy traveler, etc.</p>
    <p>We do not accept sponsorships or referrals from card issuers. Our reviews are based on publicly available documentation and, where available, community feedback and long-term user reports.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Use Cases -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Who Uses These Reviews — and What For</h2>
    <p>If you want a card for everyday spend, lounge access, travel perks or to avoid foreign transaction fees — our reviews help you compare which card fits best, depending on your lifestyle. Frequent travelers, expatriates, people with mixed currency spend or those chasing maximal rewards tend to benefit most.</p>
    <p>We also cover niche needs: rebuilding credit, low-cost cards, digital-first cards, cards with strong fraud protection, and products optimized for non-US residents or global travellers.</p>
