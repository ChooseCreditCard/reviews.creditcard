          “Best card” lists and 5-star ratings are everywhere, but the structure behind a review matters more than the headline. This page explains how to build – and read – credit card reviews in a transparent, documentation-first way.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>Why Review Structure Matters More Than Stars</h2>
      <p>Most credit card reviews look similar on the surface: a few pros and cons, a star rating, and a “best for” label. But behind the scenes, there can be large differences in how data is collected, how scores are calculated and how commercial incentives influence what you see.</p>
      <p>Reviews.Creditcard focuses on the <strong>framework</strong> for reviews, not on specific issuers. The goal is to help you recognise when a review page is designed to inform you – and when it is mainly designed to push you toward a particular application button.</p>
      <p>This minisite is part of The CreditCard Collection and is <strong>educational only</strong>. It does not rate individual cards or provide financial advice.</p>

    <!-- Anatomy of a review -->
    <section id="anatomy" class="section">
      <h2>Anatomy of a Transparent Credit Card Review</h2>
      <p>A neutral credit card review can still be opinionated – but it should be clear where facts end and opinions begin. A solid structure usually includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data summary:</strong> Key facts like FX fees, annual fees, APR ranges, network, lounge access and insurance, pulled from official documents.</li>
        <li><strong>Use-case focus:</strong> Who the card may suit (for example, frequent travellers vs. occasional shoppers) without claiming it is “best for everyone”.</li>
        <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> An explanation of which metrics were used to score or compare the card.</li>
        <li><strong>Disclosure:</strong> Clear information on whether the site earns commission if you apply.</li>
        <li><strong>Update log:</strong> When key data was last checked against issuer documentation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On Choose.Creditcard, this type of structure will feed into more systematic comparison tables and directories rather than standalone “review articles”.</p>

    <!-- Red flags -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Common Red Flags in Card Review Pages</h2>
      <p>Not every glossy review page is built with your interests first. Typical warning signs include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lists where every “top” card comes from the same small group of issuers.</li>
        <li>Very strong language (“best”, “must-have”) without clear methodology.</li>
        <li>Missing or buried disclosures about commissions and referral fees.</li>
        <li>Little or no discussion of FX fees, penalties, insurance exclusions or limits.</li>
        <li>Identical language across many sites, suggesting generic marketing copy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This minisite does not claim that all affiliate-based reviews are bad. Instead, it argues that reviews should be explicit about incentives so you can weigh them accordingly.</p>
